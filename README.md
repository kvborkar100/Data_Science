# Data Science portfolio by Krushna Borkar
Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Stand Alone Projects

### 1. __[Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning](https://github.com/kvborkar100/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/test%20-%20urldetect)__
A phishing website detector(webapp) based on Random Forest algorithm. User have to enter the URL and,then the features from the URL such as alexa ranking, URL length,Domain, sub domain etc, total 27 features are extracted from URL. Then machine Learning model(Random Forest Classifier) will try to classify it into Phishing, Benign, Suspecious category. i have used dataset from UCI machine Learning Repository.It is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites).

Tools : Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Django

## Data Analysis and Visualisation

### 1. __[911 Calls - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/kvborkar100/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/911%20Calls%20EDA%20.ipynb)__
Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.

### 2. __[Internet Speed in India Data Analysis](https://github.com/kvborkar100/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Internet%20Speed%20in%20India%20-%20EDA%20final.ipynb)__
Complete Data Analysis of dataset containing more than 24 milion rows for speed testcarried out in different states in India with diffrerent technologies. Dataset is obtained from __[Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India](https://data.gov.in/)__<br>
You can find this dataset __[Here](https://data.gov.in/catalog/myspeed-crowdsourced-mobile-data-speeds)__

Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

## Kaggle Kernels

### 1. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. It is known as the the 'Hello World' on Kaggle. This is a binary classification problem where we have to predict whether passenger wil survive or not. Here is my __[kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kvborkar100/titanic-survival-prediction)__

### 2. Big Mart Sales Predictions
Big Mart Sales Predictions data set contains data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities.I have built a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.This problem is good for introdution to feature engineering __[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/kvborkar100/big-mart-sales-prediction)__ is the Kernel.

### 3. House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is the knowledge competition on Kaggle. Thedataset contains many large number of features.This dataset has given me opportunity for feature transformation and data visualization. __[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/kvborkar100/house-prices-prediction)__ is my kernel

## Machine Learning

### 1. __[Restaurant Reviews classification using Natural Language processing](https://github.com/kvborkar100/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Restaurant%20Reviews%20classification%20using%20NLP.ipynb)__
In this project I have built a classifier that classify a restaurant review as Good or Bad. The restaurant review dataset contains 1000 reviews with labels 1(Good) and 0(Bad).
Tools: scikit-learn, NLTK

### 2. __[Prediction of score of a Beer](https://github.com/kvborkar100/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/How%20to%20choose%20perfect%20Beer.ipynb)__
In this project I have built a regression model to predict the score of a beer based on different features of the beer. dataset can be found __[here](https://www.machinehack.com/course/how-to-choose-the-perfect-beer/)__

### 3. __[Multiclass classification - to predict damage to building](https://github.com/kvborkar100/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Predict%20Damage%20to%20building.ipynb)__
In this problem I have built a model that can predict the extent of damage that has been done to a building after an earthquake. it is a multiclass classification problem. Dataset is available __[here](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/machine-learning-challenge-6-1/machine-learning/predict-the-energy-used-612632a9-3f496e7f/)__
